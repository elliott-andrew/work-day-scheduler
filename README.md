  # Work Day Scheduler
  ## Description
  The Work Day Scheduler allows a user to input tasks to be completed for the day and organize them by the time they would like the task completed. Tasks are stored in local storage, so the user can access them after navigating away from the page. As time progresses throughout the day, the color of each row will change to notify the user of their progress.
